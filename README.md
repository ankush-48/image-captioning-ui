# 🖼️ Image Captioning UI (Flask + HTML/CSS)

This project provides a simple web UI for uploading an image and displaying a caption generated by an AI model. It uses **Flask** as the backend and **HTML/CSS** for the frontend. The default captioning logic is mocked (a placeholder), and our team can plug in the real model.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- User uploads an image via the UI.
- Flask saves the image to `/static/uploaded_image.jpg`.
- The function `generate_caption()` in `app.py` is called.
- It returns a text string as a "caption" which is displayed below the image.

## 🧠 TO-DO for Integration with Your Model

 team need to **edit only one function** in `app.py`:

### 🔧 1. Modify the `generate_caption()` function

```python
def generate_caption(image_path):
    # CURRENT DUMMY CODE:
    return "A placeholder caption for the image."

    # 🧠 YOUR TASK:
    # Replace this with actual model prediction logic.

Here’s how our  team can plug in their model (just an example):

from model.caption_model import predict_caption  # ← their model file & function

def generate_caption(image_path):
    caption = predict_caption(image_path)  # Their function to get caption
    return caption

📌 2. Model Requirements
 to ensure:

The model takes image path (image_path) as input

The model returns a string caption as output

All necessary files (tokenizer, weights, etc.) are properly imported and loaded in their model file
